# Data Types vs. Abstract Data Types

## What is a data type?
Two important things about data types:
* defines a certain *domain* of values
* defines *operations* allowed on those values

E.g. **float** type
* takes only floating point values -- domain
* operations: addition, subtraction, mult., division, etc. (bitwise and % ops are not allowed)
